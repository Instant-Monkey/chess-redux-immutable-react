This is a chess game for the browser done with react, redux, immutable.js and a TDD approach. This was done for training purposes.

My goal was to develop an application where I write the logic first, make sure it works using test before developping the ui. It was also the occasion to learn more about working with immutable data structures.

I choose chess because the rules are quite well known, simple but with a few exceptions though that make things interesting.

I have to say I love working this way, seeing all the logic work from scratch while developing the ui is quite satysfying.
